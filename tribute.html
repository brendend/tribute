                <li><b>1970</b> - published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical
                cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity.</li>
            </br>    
                <li><b>1974</b> - Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). 
                He worked with a friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne, and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was a black hole</li>
            </br>
                <li><b>1979</b> - In 1979, Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: 
                "Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?" and proposed N=8 Supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.</li>
            </br>
                <li><b>2018</b> - Died from complications of ALS, March 14.</li>
